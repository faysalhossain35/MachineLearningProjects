# Machine Learning Projects
This repository includes some projects that i have done in my machine learning journey that includes from data visualisation, EDA, to 
Advance Machine Learning techniques. It also includes kaggle datasets:

1) House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques: https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques
2) Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster: https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic
3) Digit Recognizer: https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer


In deep learning, i tried to implement CNN, autoEncoder, GAN, RNN with tensorflow and Keras.
